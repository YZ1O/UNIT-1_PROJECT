Employee Management System
Overview
A command-line interface (CLI) program that allows users to manage employee information and search for salaries.
The system has two main users: the Employee and the Manager.
Each of them can perform several tasks to manage employee data effectively.

As an employee, I should be able to:
View my personal information.

Search for my salary based on my name or ID.

Update my contact details.

As a manager, I should be able to:
Add a new employee.

View all employees.

Search for an employee.

Update employee information.

Remove an employee from the system.

Export salary reports.

Usage

Type view_all_employees to list all employees.

Type add_employee to add a new employee to the system.

Type search_employee employee_name to search for an employee.

Type update_employee employee_id to update employee details.

Type remove_employee employee_id to delete an employee.
